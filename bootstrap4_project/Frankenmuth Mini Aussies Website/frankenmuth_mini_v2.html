            <p class="card-text"><p>Frankenmuth Mini Aussies is a breeding business
                originating in Frankenmuth, Michigan. It was created by Karistia Lipowicz in 2021.</p>
            <p>Karistia has been passionate about dogs for some time. Since she was a little girl she always had dogs in her life as
                they were regarded as an important part of the family.
                She realized that she wanted to pursue her passion by breeding her favorite kind of dog : the Miniature Australian
                Shepherd (also known as 'American Shepherd').
                Her adventure began in October 2021 when her dame, Lacie, gave birth to 7 gorgeous, happy and healthy puppies.</p>
            <p>Frankenmuth Mini Aussies offers a warm and loving environment for puppies to grow and develop into the best versions
                of themselves. We live in a safe community in a rural area with plenty of room to run around and play.
                When considering one of our puppies you can be certain that they have been cared for very well, with love and ample
                attention, and that they will be happy and healthy if you decide to take one home with you.</p>

            <p>One of three red merles in Lacie's first litter, Pavo started off as the smaller one of the trio and ended up being one of the biggest pups come 7 weeks of age. This adorable guy with a big buddha belly is bound to be on the larger-end of the Mini Aussie size spectrum. He is a loving, playful, and energetic male who is waiting for the perfect home!  </p>

            <h2>Persius</h2>
            <p>On the spectrum of low energy to spastic, bounce-off-the-walls wild, our male red merle pup Persius appears to be in the lower-middle part of the range. He is a happy pup no doubt, though he keeps a bit more to himself and is somewhat more aloof. Nevertheless he's always willing to give puppy kisses and people always get his tail wagging. He has a warm heart and is a gentle soul. If you seek a more low-key version of a mini aussie, he may just be your guy!</p>

                <p>This little fellow has been lovingly called 'Mr Panda' by his breeders,given his more unique facial markings and color scheme resembling the famed asiatic creature. Much like the ever-elusive Pandas in Asia, Orion has a rare gaze that seems to look straight into your soul. This is a compliment, as it seems to suggest a deeper sentience or awareness than your typical puppy. No doubt a special little guy, Orion is warm and loving when approached and tends to do his own thing with his fellow pup companions otherwise. This one of a kind pup is just waiting to meet his perfect match!    </p>

                    learning new tricks (as well as learning how to get her way!). She is extraordinarly sweet, loving, warm, affectionate,
                    and cuddly. She will often jump onto her owner's lap or straight up into her owner's arms. Her affectionate and loving
                    nature translates very well to being a caring, protective, and responsible mother to her pups.</p>

                    constant is his soft and gentle disposition, which tells one quite clearly that he wouldn't hurt a fly. This kind nature
                    translated well in his fatherly duties to his puppies. </p>
